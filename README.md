# Computer Graphics and Animation Lab Report (TU 5th Sem BCA)

This repository contains lab reports and code examples for the Computer Graphics and Animation course as part of the 5th semester in the Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) program at Tribhuvan University (TU). The aim of these labs is to illustrate fundamental graphics algorithms and principles.

## Contents

- **Lab Reports**: Detailed explanations and analysis of each lab exercise.
- **Code Samples**: Java implementations of various computer graphics algorithms.
- **Images**: Screenshots and visual outputs of the implemented algorithms.

## Lab Exercises

1. **2D and 3D Transformations**: Scaling, rotation, translation, and composite transformations in two and three dimensions.
2. **Line Drawing Algorithms**: Implementation of Bresenham's and DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) line algorithms.
3. **Circle and Ellipse Drawing Algorithms**: Symmetric and midpoint circle algorithms, ellipse algorithms.
4. **Polygon Filling Algorithms**: Implementations of flood-fill and scanline algorithms.
5. **Clipping Algorithms**: Line and polygon clipping using Cohen-Sutherland and Sutherland-Hodgman algorithms.
6. **Curves and Surfaces**: Bezier curves, B-splines.
7. **Animation**: Basic animations demonstrating transformations and motion.

## Prerequisites

- **Java**: All examples are written in Java, so a Java Development Kit (JDK) is required.
- **IDE**: Itâ€™s recommended to use an IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans for easier management and execution of the code.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Neuz-Badxhah/Computer-graphics-and-animation-lab-report-TU-5th-sem-BCA.git
